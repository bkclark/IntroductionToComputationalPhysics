    "In this assignment we will learn how to simulate the orbital dynamics of a planet going around the sun (which we assume to be fixed).  We will then proceed to use simulation to test two of the most important physics results in the last 400 years.  \n",
    "\n",
    "First, we will numerically validate Kepler's Second Law: a planet sweeps out the same area of its orbit in equal time.  Kepler's first law (all planets ü™ê orbit in ellipses) and Kepler's third law (the square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit) will be left as extra credit.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we will see that general relativity alters the Newtonian law of gravitation in such a way that the planets no longer move in ellipses.  Instead, their closest approach to the sun (the perihelion) changes its location slightly as you go around the Sun.  Mesuring this effect in Mercury was one of the key original validations of general relativity."

A special property of an inverse-square force is that bound orbits close on themselves‚Äîthe orientation in space of the ellipse remains fixed. But if gravity were to deviate from a purely inverse-square force law, bound orbits would not close (unless they were perfectly circular), and could not strictly be described as ellipses.\n",

Mercury‚Äôs distance from (the center of) the sun varies from 46,001,200 km at perihelion (the point at which Mercury is closest to the sun) to 69,816,900 km at aphelion, so it samples the strength of the sun‚Äôs gravitational pull over a significant range of distance.\n",

    "Our goal in this exercise is to determine how general relativity affects the precision of Mercury.  We know from Kepler's laws that objects orbiting around a central body orbit in an ellipse.  That means the second time around their orbit they come back to the same place that they started.  If you have more then two bodies (like above) or if there are corrections to gravity from general relativity (which there are), then you aren't going to come back exactly to the same place.  Instead the orbit precesses around.  There's a good picture [here](https://aether.lbl.gov/www/classes/p10/gr/PrecessionperihelionMercury.htm).   \n",

The most sensible thing is to start at the perihelion and then measure its closest distance when it comes around again.  This is not too hard to do but a bit tricky to get correct.  Here is a good prescription:\n",
    "* Start at the perihelion. \n",
    "* Perform slightly more then one orbit (say 10% more)\n",

    "*  Now, because you are taking discrete time steps, the closest location you find might not actually be the closest location (because maybe it got closer somewhere between the steps you took).  This will matter for this measurement.  To fix this, let's interpolate between around this part of the orbit.  \n",
